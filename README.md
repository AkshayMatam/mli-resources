## Machine Learning Interpretability(MLI)

Machine learning algorithms create potentially more accurate models than linear models, but any increase in accuracy over more traditional, better-understood, and more easily explainable techniques is not practical for those who must explain their models to regulators or customers. For many decades, the models created by machine learning algorithms were taken to be black-boxes. However, a recent flurry of research has introduced credible techniques for interpreting complex, machine-learned models. Materials presented here illustrate applications or adaptations of these techniques for practicing data scientists.
